####Instructions

You probably noticed that you most likely were not able to crack all of the user hashes in both the Windows and Linux portions of the lab. This is because these passwords were not in either of our word lists. As a bonus exercise, go online and find your own word list and use it to crack the admin user accounts for both Windows and Linux users. You may also want to try running john in brute force mode to crack the remaining passwords. Good luck!

This concludes the lab exercise.
